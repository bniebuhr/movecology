# mov(ement) ecology

This is a repository to share codes on animal movement analyses and simulations. 

# Repository description

Up to this moment, there is code to deal with:
- correction of summer and winter time in animal movement data (that in some cases may lead to complications);
- data cleaning and regularizing for animal GPS movement data;
- building home range accumulation curves based on MCP and KDE appraches;
- a presentation on integrated step-selection approach to understand resource selection and animal movement;
- fitting multiple models to animal movement data, according to [Da Silveira et al. (2016)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0156688).

Most of the folders have further description within them.
